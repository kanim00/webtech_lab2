    </p>

      <p>Dear Friends,

      </p>

      <p>
        It is my pleasure to present
        <a href="https://www.ashesi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AR-2020.pdf"
           style ="text-decoration: none;color:red"
          >Ashesi's 2020 Annual Report</a
        >
        which details the challenges <br>
        and triumphs our community experienced in a 
        year unlike any other. In March of 2020, <br> 
        Ashesi sutdents were among the first in Africa to resume their learnig, thanks to work <br>
        we started over a decade ago to move our learning and community systems online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our faculty have continued to worrk togethher with students since then
        to develop and <br>
        deploy new methods of insturction;univeristy 
        administrators also helped ensure that all <br>
        necessary tools, resources 
        and support systems were in place to support the transition.<br> 
        Donors, friends and advocates stepped up to welcome students into their homes as <br>
        we went on lockdown; helped fund emergency financial aid for 
        disadvantaged students;<br> 
        and enabled Ashesi to support incomes for all 
        auxiliary staff who would have otherwise <br>
        been out of work with campus closed. Also importantly, we pressed on with our annual <br>
        Education collaborative, convening university leaders and stakeholders across 
        Africa <br>
        and the world with a special focus on the pandemic and successful 
        strategies for<br>
        ensuring effective learning during and beyond 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lessons of 2020 and the leaderships gaps in Africa's social and
        economic<br>
        infrastructure that they ahve reminded the world of, bring even
        more urgency to our <br>
        work. For the last two decades we have steadily
        grwon our capability to educate ethical,<br>
        entrepreneurial leaders on the
        continent. The pandemic's tets of our institution, and the <br>
        Ashesi community's exemplary response to it, indicate how grounded our model
        has <br>
        become. The work that continues to happen at Ashesi, and the gains
        made since our<br>
        very first class began in 2002, will be key to deepening
        our impact as we enter Ashesi's <br>
        third decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I read a story that deeply reminded me of the power
        of cumulative <br>
        effort – sometimes over several decades – to create a
        breakthrough for global challenges. <br>
        It was the story of Katalin Karikó, a Hungarian-born researcher who had put <br>
        her career on the line for
        nearly four decades trying to harness the power of messenger<br>
        RNA (mRNA).
        Karikó persisted through personal crises, career setback, and a lack of <br>
        belief from the scientific community in her ideas. In 2020, her research
        work was <br>
        seminal to the development of Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech’s
        highly effective<br>
        COVID-19 vaccines. Karikó reminds me of many within the
        Ashesi community - faculty,<br>
        administrators, alumni and students – who
        have been engaged in quiet, diligent work to <br>
        transform Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        These efforts are establishing a foundation for the future success of
        the young leaders <br>
        we are working with today. When Africa’s tipping point
        arrives, and the continent <br>
        emerges as a stronger force for good in the
        world, we will look back at these years of<br>
        work as having made an
        immense difference. This Annual Report highlights some of the <br>
        Ashesi stories that have inspired me this year, and I hope they inspire you as
        well. I am <br>
        thankful to everyone who is with us on this journey, and the
        continued support that<br>
        makes Ashesi’s work possible
      </p>
      <p> In the spirit of Ashesi,<br>
          Patrick Awuah.</p>
